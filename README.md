Brief Description: This program was a short trivial program that prints the phrase "Hello World" if we editied the Makefile correctly. The program should, via the Makefile
		   should copy the credentials.ini file into the the hello/ subdirectory using the 'make install' command. From there, when using the 'make run' command, the
		   file hello.py will excecute and print out the phrase "Hello world" to the terminal. Once that is complete, the copy of credential.ini will be deleted from 
		   the hello/ subdirectory, leaving a clean slate.
